# UwU
A collection of different scripts that I find myself reaching for when setting up, and playing around in my linux distros. 
Current scripts are setup for ubuntu based systems. 

### Setup.sh
By running this script you will install all packages that I use for basic debugging, programming, and terminal usability. A few additional packages tha t I find I use often are also included here. 

And for funsies, I also added in some scripts that are fun to have and play with when installed, but aren't required.
*although not currently setup as optional install, I plan to inlcude this soon....*
