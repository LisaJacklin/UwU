# UwU
A collection of different scripts that I find myself reaching for when setting up, and playing around in my linux distros. 

Current scripts are setup for ubuntu based systems. 

## Setup.sh
By running this script you will install all packages that I use for basic debugging, programming, and terminal usability. A few additional packages tha t I find I use often are also included here. 

This can be a bit of a long install...
